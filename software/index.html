In addition, the majority of the operating software is made available to customers as source code under the <tooltip data-title="GNU General Public License" data-body="Open Source Software license">GPL</tooltip>. Where products are deployed with a host side driver, this driver is supplied for the user&rsquo;s Linux host system as source code, licensed under the <tooltip data-title="GNU General Public License" data-body="Open Source Software license">GPL</tooltip>.</p><p>Because the products make extensive use of standard TCP/IP networking, control from other platforms such as Windows is readily achieved. <em><strong>DTACQ</strong></em> provides free of charge a highly functional, portable reference Remote Client program that will work on all of Linux, Windows, MAC OSX and Solaris. We highly recommend use of the Remote Client, at least for initial testing, and it is quite possible that this is all the host side software that you&rsquo;ll need.</p><p>The control interface is based on simple ASCII commands. This means that the cards are uniquely easy to control, typically using simple scripts. Customers have implemented their own remote clients operating over the remote interface, in a variety of languages including Bash, Perl, Labview, MATLAB, <tooltip data-title=MDSplus data-body="A set of software tools for data acquisition and storage and a methodology for management of complex scientific data.">MDSplus</tooltip>/TDI, Java and regular C code.</p><p>New 4G appliances include an <tooltip data-title="Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System" data-body="A set of software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes and other large scientific experiments.">EPICS</tooltip> IOC to manage application logic, and to publish control and data PV&rsquo;s on the network.

A number of channelise, subset and data combing functions are available. When calibrated, the card makes per channel, per range scaling information available so that client software is able to scale data accurately. Three strategies for data upload are available:</p><ul><li><b>Host-Pull</b> : the host computer requests the data and pulls from the Target ACQ card as required.</li><li><b>Target-Push</b> : the target ACQ card pushes data to a host side repository as it becomes available. This method is simple to implement - the host side repository could be a simple ftp server, or a dedicated data service such as MDSIP, and, using the minimum host side cpu resources, is highly efficient and saleable.</li><li><b>Push-Pull</b> : the target ACQ card will upload a data subset as it becomes available. The Host identifies regions of interest ROI in the uploaded data and requests more detailed data sets from these regions.</li><li>High performance PCI-Express cable and SFP+ fiber optic links are also available, to allow full rate streaming, typically at about 100MB/s, but potentially up to 1GB/s is achievable.</li></ul><p>Second generation products also make extensive use of web pages for diagnostics, and optional control pages are available. So it is possible to control capture via a web page, and to specify data upload - for example to a remote ftp server - via a web page. No drivers required!, only a web browser. The cards support a Web Service remote procedure call interface for automated connection to other computer systems.</p><p>Since the second generation target is a full function, virtual memory Linux system, it is, in principle, possible to port almost any POSIX compliant networked data handling application. For example, the target system features an ssh client (<tooltip data-title=Dropbear data-body="Dropbear is a relatively small SSH 2 server and client. It runs on a variety of POSIX-based platforms.
